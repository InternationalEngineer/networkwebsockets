Named WebSockets Chat Demo
===

A simple chat client on top of [Named WebSockets](https://github.com/richtr/namedwebsockets).

#### Running the example

1. Ensure a Named WebSockets Proxy is running as detailed in the root project [README](https://github.com/richtr/namedwebsockets/blob/master/README.md#run-a-named-websockets-proxy).

2. Open `chat.html` in a browser window.

3. Open `chat.html` in another browser window on the local machine or on another device that is also running a Named WebSockets proxy in the local network.

4. Send messages from one chat window and watch the chat message appear in the other chat window (and vice-versa).
