Named WebSockets PubSub Demo
===

A basic [publish/subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishâ€“subscribe_pattern) demo on top of [Named WebSockets](https://github.com/namedwebsockets/namedwebsockets).

#### Running the example

1. Ensure the Named WebSockets Proxy has been downloaded and is currently running on your local machine. You can download pre-built Named WebSocket Proxy binaries [here](https://github.com/namedwebsockets/namedwebsockets/releases).

    NOTE: Ultimately, this step should not be required with all proxy functionality implemented within user agents.

2. Open [`pubsub.html`](http://namedwebsockets.github.io/namedwebsockets/examples/pubsub/pubsub.html) on your local machine.

3. Open [`pubsub.html`](http://namedwebsockets.github.io/namedwebsockets/examples/pubsub/pubsub.html) in another browser window on the local machine or on another device that is also running a Named WebSockets proxy in the local network.

4. Log in and out on one window using the interface provided and watch the authorization state get applied to the other window (and vice-versa).
