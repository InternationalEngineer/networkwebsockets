Named WebSockets PubSub Demo
===

A basic [publish/subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishâ€“subscribe_pattern) demo on top of [Named WebSockets](https://github.com/richtr/namedwebsockets).

#### Running the example

1. Ensure a Named WebSockets Proxy is running as detailed in the root project [README](https://github.com/richtr/namedwebsockets/blob/master/README.md#run-a-named-websockets-proxy).

2. Open `pubsub.html` in a browser window.

3. Open `pubsub.html` in another browser window on the local machine or on another device that is also running a Named WebSockets proxy in the local network.

4. Log in and out on one window using the interface provided and watch the authorization state get applied to the other window (and vice-versa).
